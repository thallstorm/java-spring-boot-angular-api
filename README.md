# Java Spring Boot API with Angular Front End

After you download the repository
    - Run HeidiSQL
    - Load your DB
    - Build and run the geodataapi app (at this stage you can test each endpoint with Postman, or curl @localhost:8080/api/...)
    - Open a terminal and run $ng serve --open (you need node.js to run angular)
